# OpenCarnivores

A modern source port of **Carnivores 2** (Action Forms, 1999), reborn on SDL2 + OpenGL 3.3 + OpenAL Soft. The original DirectX 6 / DirectSound / x86 Glide binaries are gone; the engine now builds and runs natively on 64-bit Windows 10/11 and is being prepared for Linux, macOS, and VR.

## Quick start (for players)

**You need a legal copy of Carnivores 2.** The CD, a GOG copy, or an old install folder all work — anything that contains the `HUNTDAT/` folder and the `*.RSC`, `*.CAR`, `*.MAP`, `*.WAV` game files.

### Step 1 — Get the game files
If you own the CD, copy everything off it into a folder on your PC (for example, `C:\Games\Carnivores2`). Make sure the folder contains a `HUNTDAT` subfolder. If your copy already has a `Carn2.exe`, you can leave it — OpenCarnivores will live next to it.

### Step 2 — Download OpenCarnivores
Go to the **[Releases page](https://github.com/pRs3k/OpenCarnivores/releases)** on GitHub and download the latest `OpenCarnivores-Windows.zip`. Unzip it.

### Step 3 — Put the files together
Copy `OpenCarnivores.exe` (and the `.dll` files and `shaders/` folder next to it) into your Carnivores 2 folder — the one with `HUNTDAT` inside it.

### Step 4 — Double-click `OpenCarnivores.exe`
That's it. The game should launch at your monitor's native resolution.

### Troubleshooting
- **"Missing file" or black screen on launch** — you probably don't have the `HUNTDAT` folder next to `OpenCarnivores.exe`. Re-check Step 3.
- **Game is too dark or too bright** — open the in-game Options menu and adjust the Brightness slider; it updates live.
- **Resolution looks wrong** — open Options → Display and pick a resolution from the list. The choice is saved to `display.cfg`.

## What's new vs. the original engine

- **Runs on modern Windows** without compatibility shims, wrappers, or dgVoodoo2
- **Any resolution, any aspect ratio** — widescreen Hor+ FOV, 4K, HiDPI-aware
- **Adaptive VSync** and uncapped framerate
- **OpenGL 3.3 renderer** with hardware trilinear mipmapping (no more terrain texture pop, no more foliage shimmer)
- **OpenAL Soft audio** — 3D positional audio, terrain occlusion, ready for HRTF and EFX reverb
- **PNG / TGA / BMP / JPEG / DDS texture overrides** at any resolution with true 8-bit alpha (see below)
- **glTF / OBJ model overrides** alongside the retail `.CAR` files
- **PBR materials** (normal / metallic-roughness / AO maps) per-asset, opt-in
- **Custom GLSL shaders per asset** via `.material` files — no C++ required
- **Hot reload** for textures, shaders, `.material` files, and `_RES.txt` — edit & save, no restart
- Many subtle rendering and AI fixes

All original game assets (`.CAR`, `.3DF`, `.RSC`, `.MAP`, `.TGA`, `.WAV`) load **unchanged**.

## For modders: high-resolution texture overrides

Previously, every in-world texture in Carnivores 2 was stored inside the binary `.CAR` / `.3DF` / `.RSC` files as **RGB555 (15-bit color + 1-bit transparency key)** — only 32,768 possible colors, fixed resolutions (256×256 for models, 128×128 for terrain), and no partial alpha. Editing anything meant ripping pixels out of binary files with third-party tools.

**You can now drop a PNG (or TGA/BMP/JPEG/DDS) next to any game asset and OpenCarnivores will use it instead** — at any resolution, with true 24-bit color and 8-bit alpha, automatically mipmapped by the GPU.

The original files are never touched. If you delete the override, the game reverts to the original textures with zero fuss.

### Naming convention

Place override files in the game folder following this pattern:

| Asset | Override file | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Standalone `.3DF` (sun, moon, compass, binoculars) | `<same-stem>.png` next to the original | `HUNTDAT/BINOCUL.png` next to `HUNTDAT/BINOCUL.3DF` |
| Character `.CAR` (dinos, weapons, ship, wind) | `<same-stem>.png` next to the original | `HUNTDAT/TREX.png` next to `HUNTDAT/TREX.CAR` |
| Terrain textures (baked into the `.RSC`) | `<ProjectName>_tex_NN.png` in the game root | `AREA1_tex_00.png`, `AREA1_tex_01.png`, … |
| Object 3D models (baked into the `.RSC`) | `<ProjectName>_obj_NN.png` | `AREA1_obj_00.png` |
| Object billboards (baked into the `.RSC`) | `<ProjectName>_obj_NN_bmp.png` | `AREA1_obj_00_bmp.png` |
| Sky dome | `<ProjectName>_sky.png` | `AREA1_sky.png` |

- `<ProjectName>` is the base name of the map's `.rsc` file, lowercase/uppercase as used by the game.
- `NN` is a zero-padded 2-digit index matching the load order in the `.RSC` (texture 0 → `_tex_00.png`, texture 1 → `_tex_01.png`, etc.).
- Extensions are probed in order: `.dds`, `.png`, `.tga`, `.bmp`, `.jpg` — first one found wins. DDS (BC1/3/5/7) is ~4–6× smaller in VRAM than raw RGBA, ideal for 4K packs.

### How to port an existing texture mod

1. **Rip** the textures you want to replace out of the `.CAR` / `.RSC` using your favorite tool (e.g. [C3Dit](https://github.com/carnivores-cpe/c3dit)). Or, for the `.RSC` textures, just reference the load order in the RSC file.
2. **Upscale / repaint** at any resolution — 512×512, 1024×1024, even 4K. Save as 32-bit PNG with alpha if you want smooth transparency.
3. **Name and drop** the file per the table above.
4. **Launch the game.** That's it.

You don't need to recompile anything, repack the `.RSC`, or modify game files. Remove the PNG to revert. Mix and match with other mods freely — overrides take priority over the binary data, and two texture packs that override different files coexist without conflict. **Hot reload** means you can edit a PNG in your image editor, hit save, and the game picks up the new version within a second — no restart.

### Tips

- Transparent pixels in the original had to be solid color-key; PNG alpha gives you smooth edges on leaves, glass, smoke, and water trims.
- Model UVs are normalized 0..1, so any resolution works — a 1024×1024 PNG just looks 4× sharper than the original 256×256.
- The game's alpha-test shader discards pixels under ~10% opacity, so feathered edges near full transparency work as you'd expect.
- High-res textures increase VRAM use; a modern GPU handles it easily, but a full 4K texture pack will use more memory than the original.

## PBR materials (normal / metallic-roughness / AO)

Drop these sibling files next to your base texture and they'll be picked up automatically:

| Map | Filename suffix | Channel convention |
|---|---|---|
| Normal | `<stem>_normal.png` | Tangent-space RGB |
| Metallic-roughness | `<stem>_mr.png` | Metallic in R, roughness in G (glTF) |
| Ambient occlusion | `<stem>_ao.png` | Greyscale in R |

PBR is strictly opt-in per asset. Assets without these sibling files continue to use the original Lambert shading, pixel-for-pixel. Tangent frames are reconstructed in the fragment shader from screen-space derivatives — you don't need to regenerate UV seams or tangent data.

---

## Custom shaders per asset (`.material` files)

Drop `<stem>.material` next to any asset to attach a custom GLSL program — e.g. `HUNTDAT/TREX.material` next to `HUNTDAT/TREX.CAR`. Line-based directive syntax:

```
shader  custom_tint            # loads shaders/custom_tint.vert + .frag
tex     uDetail  noise.png     # binds to next free sampler unit (unit 0 = albedo)
float   uMix     0.25
vec3    uTint    1.05 1.0 0.95
```

Editing the `.material` file, the `.vert`, or the `.frag` hot-reloads live. Precedence at draw time is **custom material → PBR material → default Lambert**. A reference pair and annotated template ship in `shaders/custom_tint.{vert,frag}` and `shaders/example.material`.

---

## glTF / OBJ model overrides

Drop `<stem>.gltf`, `<stem>.glb`, or `<stem>.obj` next to the retail `.CAR` and it replaces the model geometry (textures still come from the PNG sibling or the original `.CAR` data). Retail `.CAR` loading is untouched and remains the fallback.

---

## For modders: data-driven dino & weapon stats (JSON overlays)

Every dinosaur and weapon stat (health, damage, precision, smell/hearing/sight, trophy score, reload time, etc.) was previously baked into the retail `HUNTDAT/_res.txt` script. OpenCarnivores still reads `_res.txt` as the authoritative baseline, but you can now drop a JSON overlay next to it to tweak or add entries without touching the original file.

### Quick start

Create `HUNTDAT/dinos.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "dinosaurs": [
    {
      "name": "T-Rex",      // matches the retail entry by name
      "health": 1500,       // buffed from 1024
      "basescore": 25,
      "smell": 0.95
    },
    {
      "name": "Moschops",
      "health": 4           // nerfed so the shotgun doesn't one-shot
    }
  ]
}
```

Create `HUNTDAT/weapons.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "weapons": [
    { "name": "Shotgun", "power": 2.0, "shots": 8, "reload": 900 },
    { "name": "Sniper",  "prec": 1.4, "loud": 0.2 }
  ]
}
```

That's it — launch the game and the stats apply. Only fields present in the JSON are overwritten; everything you don't mention keeps its `_res.txt` value. **Hot reload** is wired: save the file and the running game re-layers the overlay within a second.

### Matching rules

Each entry is looked up against the retail table in this order:

1. `"id"` — retail index (0..N-1 after `_res.txt` loads). Most exact, brittle if another mod reorders the table.
2. `"ai"` — AI type constant (dinos only; `AI_TREX=18`, etc. — see `Hunt.h`).
3. `"name"` — exact case-sensitive match against the `name` in `_res.txt`.

If none of the above hit, the entry is appended as a brand-new creature or weapon. Capacity is 32 dinos and 8 weapons total across `_res.txt` + JSON.

### Supported fields

**Dinos**: `name`, `file`, `pic`, `ai`, `health`, `basescore`, `mass`, `length`, `radius`, `smell`, `hear`, `look`, `scale0`, `scaleA`, `shipdelta`, `danger` (bool)
**Weapons**: `name`, `file`, `pic`, `power`, `prec`, `loud`, `rate`, `shots`, `reload`, `trace`, `optic` (bool), `fall` (bool)

The parser accepts `//` line comments and `/* block */` comments — real JSON doesn't, but a modder config file is a better experience with them. Annotated templates live in `docs/dinos.example.json` and `docs/weapons.example.json`.

## For modders: the `mods/` folder

Open the main menu and click **MODS** in the bottom-right corner. Any folder under `./mods/` is listed there; click a name to toggle it on or off. The enabled set is saved to `mods.cfg`.

> **Heads up:** the virtual filesystem that actually honours this list is still landing — today the UI is in place and `mods.cfg` is written, but the engine still reads assets directly from the game root. Once the VFS ships (next release), a folder under `mods/` that mirrors the game layout — e.g. `mods/MyPack/HUNTDAT/TREX.png` — will be mounted on top of the retail files at launch. Retail files are never modified, overlapping mods resolve by list order (top = highest priority), and uninstalling is deleting the folder.

Old mod packs that shipped a zipped game install (including a `Carn2.exe`) work too: unzip into `mods/<PackName>/`, ignore the bundled EXE, and launch `OpenCarnivores.exe`. The `.CAR`/`.RSC`/`.TGA`/`.WAV` files the pack ships still load through the original retail parsers.

---

## Coming next

Planned additions that will further expand what modders can do (see `CLAUDE.md` for the full roadmap):

- Virtual filesystem with `mods/` folder priority — clean mod packs, no file overwrites (UI landed this release, file routing next)
- Lua scripting for AI and gameplay events
- VR support (OpenXR)
